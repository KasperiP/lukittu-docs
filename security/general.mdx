## Introduction

Lukittu client-server communication employs a sophisticated hybrid cryptographic system that combines both asymmetric (RSA 2048) and symmetric encryption to ensure maximum security and integrity. This documentation provides a detailed overview of the communication processes.

## HTTP Communication Security

The general HTTP communication between client and server implements asymmetric cryptography with the following characteristics:

- Server maintains an RSA 2048 key pair:
  - Private key (secured on server)
  - Public key (distributed to clients)
- Clients possess only the server's public key
- Challenge-response verification ensures request authenticity
- All transmitted data is cryptographically signed

### HTTP Communication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Note over Server: RSA 2048 key pair:<br/>Private key (secured)<br/>Public key (distributed)

    Note over Client: Generate cryptographic challenge
    Client->>Server: Send request
    Note over Client,Server: Request payload:<br/>1. Cryptographic challenge<br/>2. Request body data<br/>

    Note over Server: 1. Sign challenge with<br/>private key (RSA 2048)
    Server->>Client: Send response
    Note over Client,Server: Response payload:<br/>1. Digital signature<br/>2. Response data<br/>

    Note over Client: Security checks:<br/>1. Verify RSA 2048 signature<br/>2. Validate challenge match<br/>

    alt All security checks pass
        Note over Client: Process validated response
    else Any check fails
        Note over Client: Reject response<br/>Log security exception
    end
```

## Classloader Security Architecture

The Classloader implements an advanced encryption scheme that protects both data in transit and ensures secure class loading:

- Uses RSA 2048 for key exchange
- Implements AES-256-GCM for chunk encryption
- Maintains zero-persistence security model
- Employs session-based encryption with rotating keys

### Classloader Communication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client Classloader
    participant Backend as Lukittu Backend
    participant Memory as Client Memory

    Note over Client: 1. Generate random session ID<br/>2. Access RSA 2048 public key

    Client->>Client: Encrypt session ID using<br/>RSA 2048 OAEP padding

    Client->>Backend: Send encrypted session ID<br/>+ authentication parameters

    Note over Backend: 1. RSA 2048 private key<br/>2. Security validation suite
    Backend->>Backend: 1. RSA decrypt session ID<br/>2. Validate session parameters<br/>3. Verify license credentials
    Backend->>Backend: Generate AES session key

    loop For each class chunk
        Backend->>Backend: 1. AES-256-GCM encryption<br/>2. Generate auth tag
        Backend->>Client: Stream encrypted chunk + IV
        Client->>Client: 1. Verify auth tag<br/>2. Decrypt with session key
        Client->>Memory: Load verified class
        Note over Memory: Zero-persistence:<br/>Classes only exist in memory
    end

    Note over Client,Memory: Runtime security:<br/>No persistence to disk<br/>
```
