## Creating a Stripe Product for Lukittu

Follow these steps to create and configure a Stripe product for use with Lukittu:

### Steps to Create a Stripe Product

1. **Access the Stripe Dashboard**
   Navigate to the **Product Catalog** section on your Stripe dashboard.

2. **Add a Product**

   * Click the **Add a Product** button.

   * Enter a product name.

     * **Tip:** Use the same name as your Lukittu product for consistency and easier identification.

3. **Locate Metadata Options**

   * Depending on your device, you should see a **More Options** dropdown.

   * Open the dropdown and locate the **Metadata** section.

     * **Note:** Metadata allows you to add custom data to your Stripe product. Lukittu uses this metadata to map Stripe products to its backend.

### Required Metadata for Lukittu

Add the following metadata key-value pairs to your product:

| **Key**      | **Description**                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `product_id` | Your Lukittu product ID (required for identification). |

### Optional Metadata for Lukittu

The following metadata keys are optional and can be added as needed:

| **Key**            | **Type**                   | **Description**                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ip_limit`         | Number                     | Maximum number of IPs allowed.                                                                    |
| `seats`            | Number                     | Number of concurrent users allowed.                                                               |
| `expiration_days`  | Number                     | Number of days until the license expires.                                                         |
| `expiration_start` | `ACTIVATION` or `CREATION` | Determines when expiration starts (default: `CREATION`). Applicable if `expiration_days` is used. |

### Notes on Expiration and Subscriptions

* **For Subscription-Based Products**
  Do not use any expiration-related metadata (`expiration_days`, `expiration_start`).

  * **Why:** Lukittu automatically handles license expiration for subscription-based products.

  * If a payment is not received, the license will expire automatically at the end of the billing period.

* **For One-Time Payment Products**
  Expiration metadata can be used as outlined above to define license durations.
