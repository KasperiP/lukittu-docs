## What is Lukittu?

Lukittu is an advanced software licensing and distribution system designed to protect proprietary software from unauthorized sharing and misuse. While cloud-based solutions are on the rise, a significant amount of software still operates on clients' machines, bringing unique security challenges.

### Key Benefits

-   **Enhanced Security**: Prevent unauthorized software distribution through a robust licensing layer

-   **Usage Analytics**: Track who is using your software, when, and from where

-   **Easy Integration**: Simple API-driven implementation for your existing software

-   **Flexible Licensing**: Protect your intellectual property while maintaining user accessibility

For paid proprietary software, one of the main concerns is preventing users from illegally distributing the software or repurposing its code for their own solutions. This ongoing battle is often addressed through techniques like code obfuscation—making the client-facing code difficult to reverse engineer. However, obfuscation alone doesn't prevent users from sharing the software.

This is where Lukittu steps in. By introducing a **licensing layer** on top of the software, Lukittu ensures that only users with valid license keys can access and use the software. This added protection enhances security and offers several additional benefits, such as providing insights into actual software usage—including who is using the software, when they are using it, and from where.

While no solution is 100% foolproof, combining **strong obfuscation** with an **effective software licensing system** provides a robust defense against unauthorized software distribution and misuse.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Lukittu is straightforward. Here's what you need to know:

### Prerequisites

-   A software application that requires licensing protection. Common use cases for Lukittu include game scripts and add-ons running entirely on the client’s server, such as Minecraft, FiveM, Roblox, and more.

-   Basic understanding of API integration, including REST APIs and WebSockets.

-   An account on the Lukittu platform. A free tier is available to help you get started.

<Note>
    For the actual implementation, refer to the corresponding pages in this
    documentation.

## Building Your Own Licensing System vs Using Lukittu

When considering how to protect your proprietary software, you have two main options: **building your own licensing system** or using a ready-made solution like **Lukittu**. Below, we highlight the pros and cons of each approach to help you make an informed decision.

### Building Your Own Licensing System

<Note>
    Custom licensing systems offer maximum control but require significant
    resources to develop and maintain.
</Note>

#### Advantages

-   **Customization:** Full control over the licensing process, tailoring it to your software's needs.

-   **Ownership:** You own and control the system, reducing reliance on third parties.

#### Challenges

-   **Time and Complexity:** Developing a robust system is time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge.

-   **Ongoing Maintenance:** Security updates and system improvements require continuous effort and resources.

-   **Cost:** The development and maintenance of a custom solution can be expensive.

### Using Lukittu

#### Advantages

-   **Quick Setup:** Lukittu provides a pre-built, scalable licensing system that integrates easily into your software.

-   **Security:** Regular updates and built-in protection against piracy and unauthorized sharing.

-   **Insights:** Gain valuable usage analytics and track activations.

-   **Cost-Effective:** Lukittu's subscription-based model eliminates the need for upfront costs and the ongoing maintenance of a custom system. We also offer a generous free tier, so you can get started without spending a penny.

#### Challenges

-   **Less Customization:** While highly configurable, Lukittu may not provide the same level of customization as a fully custom-built system. However, if you have specific needs, feel free to contact us—we may be able to implement your requirements.

-   **Third-Party Dependency:** Using Lukittu means relying on an external service, though it's backed by strong support and security.

### Recommendations

<Warning>
    Consider your team size and resources carefully when making this decision.
    What works for a large enterprise may not be suitable for an indie
    developer.
</Warning>

    <Tab title="Indie Developers / Small Teams">
        Building your own licensing system should be carefully considered. It
        might not be worth the significant time, cost, and complexity involved
        unless you have very specific needs or the resources to support
        long-term development and maintenance.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Large Teams/Enterprises">
        A custom-built licensing system can be more beneficial, as it offers
        greater control and scalability, aligning with the complex needs of
        large organizations. Custom systems are often better suited to handle
        unique licensing models and tight integration with existing enterprise
        systems.
