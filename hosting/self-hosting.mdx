# Self-hosting Lukittu

## Current Status

As of May 7, 2025, Lukittu does not provide any official self-hosting guides or support.

## Why No Self-hosting?

Lukittu was originally designed as a SaaS solution, not as a self-hosted, single-tenant application. The platform makes several architectural assumptions:

-   **Multi-tenant environment** where anyone can register
-   Users can create their own teams
-   Shared database and infrastructure

## Third-Party Service Dependencies

Lukittu uses third-party services that are tightly coupled with the application code:

-   Sentry for error monitoring
-   Stripe for subscription management
-   Proxy/CDN (Cloudflare) configuration
-   Other external services

These integrations weren't designed to be optional or easily replaceable in a self-hosted scenario.

## Self-hosting Considerations

Self-hosting Lukittu is **not recommended** unless you have a strong understanding of its architecture and environment and you are aware of the drawbacks!

### Known Limitations

-   No support for single-tenant usage
-   No official documentation for self-hosting
-   Platform assumptions may lead to breaking changes in self-hosted setups
-   No dedicated support for self-hosted instances

## Summary

The Lukittu platform was designed as a SaaS solution with multi-tenant architecture. While technically possible, self-hosting is not officially supported and comes with significant limitations and challenges. Consider these factors carefully before attempting to self-host Lukittu.

If you need an open-source, single-tenant licensing system today, there are excellent alternatives availableâ€”such as [Keygen](https://github.com/keygen-sh/keygen-api?tab=readme-ov-file#self-hosting-with-keygen-ce).
