## Enabling Polymart Integration

Before setting up webhooks on Polymart, you need to enable the integration in your Lukittu dashboard:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Access Integrations Settings">
        Log in to your Lukittu dashboard and navigate to the **Integrations**
        tab.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Integration Secrets">
        The Polymart integration requires two secrets: - **Webhook Secret:**
        You'll get this after creating your webhook on Polymart. - **Signing
        Secret:** You'll get this when setting up the license placeholder.
        <Info>
            Both secrets are required for the integration to work properly.
            You'll add them after completing the webhook and placeholder setup
            in the following steps.
