# Products

A product in Lukittu represents a software application that you want to manage access to. Through Lukittu's flexible access control system, each license key can grant access to one or multiple products.

## Product Configuration

When implementing Lukittu in your application, you should specify which Lukittu product the software represents. While optional, this is recommended for:

- Better tracking capabilities
- Improved access management
- Enhanced usage analytics

Product identification is done using a UUID v4 product ID in your implementation.

## Release Management

### Overview

Products can maintain multiple releases to track different software versions. This feature provides:

- Version tracking across your user base
- Integration with remote classloader functionality
- Historical version management

### Release States

#### 1. Published

The standard state for active releases:

- Available to all licenses with product access
- Can be tagged as "latest" for fallback versioning
- Represents production-ready software

#### 2. Draft

Preparation state for upcoming releases:

- Created but not yet publicly available
- Allows preparation of release materials
- Can be published when ready for deployment

#### 3. Archived

Historical state for inactive releases:

- No longer available for use
- Maintained for record-keeping
- Useful for audit and tracking purposes

#### 4. Deprecated

Warning state for sunset releases:

- Remains functional and accessible
- Includes deprecation notifications
- Encourages users to upgrade
- Helps manage version transitions

### Latest Release Tag

Published releases can receive the "latest" designation:

- Only one release can be "latest" at a time
- Serves as the default version for unspecified requests
- Simplifies version management

### Release Restrictions

Control release accessibility through license-specific restrictions:

- Enable controlled beta testing
- Manage gradual version rollouts
- Test with select users before wide release
- Create exclusive access for specific licenses

## Best Practices

### Version Naming

We recommend following [semver](https://semver.org/) (Semantic Versioning) conventions:

- Provides clear version hierarchy
- Communicates change significance
- Maintains industry-standard versioning
- Helps users understand update importance
