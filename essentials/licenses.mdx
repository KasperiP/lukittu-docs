title: "Licenses"
description: "Licenses are the cornerstone of the Lukittu system, providing access control to your software. Without a valid license, users cannot access your software. License keys enable you to track software usage and prevent unauthorized access."

## License Properties

When creating a license in Lukittu, you can configure the following properties:

### License Key Format

License keys follow the format `XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX`, where X can be any character from A-Z or 0-9. Keys are unique within each team. You can either:

- Generate the key automatically through Lukittu
- Manually specify a custom key

### Expiration Types

#### 1. Never

Suitable for lifetime access products. The license will never expire once issued.

#### 2. Date

Set a specific expiration date for the license. The expiration date is timezone-aware and will be set according to your dashboard's timezone.

Example: Setting an expiration date of 12/12/2022 will make the license invalid after that date.

#### 3. Duration

Specify a time period after which the license expires. You can choose when the expiration countdown begins:

- **Creation**: Timer starts when the license is created
- **Activation**: Timer starts upon first license activation, generating an expiration date based on the activation date

### IP Limitations

Restrict the number of unique IP addresses that can use the license. Configure the IP limit period in team settings:

- **Day**: Maximum unique IPs per day
- **Week**: Maximum unique IPs per week
- **Month**: Maximum unique IPs per month

### Concurrent Users

Control how many users can simultaneously use the license. This feature:

- Tracks usage through heartbeat signals
- Uses the "Device timeout" setting from team settings to determine when a device becomes inactive
- Marks devices as inactive if no heartbeat is received within the timeout period

> ⚠️ **Important**: Dockerized environments may have issues with concurrent user limits due to difficulties in generating unique device identifiers.

### Product Assignment

Restrict license usage to specific products in your portfolio. This is useful when:

- Managing multiple products
- Creating product-specific licenses
- Implementing tiered access

### Customer Assignment

Control which customers can use the license:

- Assign multiple customers to a single license
- Enable shared license functionality
- Requires customer ID in authentication requests

### License Status

Licenses can have one of five statuses: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, EXPIRING, EXPIRED, or SUSPENDED. The status is automatically determined based on several factors:

#### Last Active Date

- Tracks when the license was last used
- Initially set to license creation date
- Updates with each license authentication request
- Used to determine inactivity status

#### Status Types

1. **ACTIVE**

   - Default status for valid, recently used licenses
   - License is within expiration period
   - Has been used within last 30 days

2. **INACTIVE**

   - No license activity for over 30 days
   - License is still valid but unused
   - Applies to all license types

3. **EXPIRING**

   - License will expire within 30 days
   - Only applies to DATE and DURATION type licenses
   - License is still valid and usable

4. **EXPIRED**

   - Past the expiration date
   - Only applies to DATE and DURATION type licenses
   - License is no longer valid

5. **SUSPENDED**
   - Manually suspended by administrator
   - Overrides all other status checks
   - License is temporarily invalid

> 📝 **Note**: A license is considered inactive if there have been no authentication requests for over 30 days, regardless of its expiration status.

#### Suspension

- Temporarily disable licenses using the suspension feature
- Suspended licenses are considered invalid
- Useful for temporary access restriction

### Metadata

Store additional license information using metadata:

- Custom fields for extra license details
- Used by integrations
- Flexible data storage for specific use cases
