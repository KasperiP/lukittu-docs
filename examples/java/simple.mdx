# Simple Java Example

You can find a pre-made example plugin here: [lukittu-java-simple](https://github.com/KasperiP/lukittu-java-simple).  
This example demonstrates a robust implementation of the Lukittu license verification system for Java applications, specifically built as a Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot plugin.

## Features

  Implements a challenge-response mechanism with cryptographic signature verification using RSA/SHA256.

- **Comprehensive Error Handling**  
  Provides clear, user-friendly messages for various license states and error conditions.

- **Heartbeat System**  
  Periodically validates the license to ensure continued legitimacy.

- **Device Identification**  
  Generates a unique hardware-based identifier to limit installations per license.

- **Security Best Practices**  
  Includes documentation of proper security measures for production-level implementation.
