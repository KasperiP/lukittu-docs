        tab. Find the Discord integration option and toggle it to **Active**.
    </Step>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the Bot to Discord">
        Invite the Lukittu bot to your server or install it for personal use by
        clicking this link:
        [https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1352929152134811679](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1352929152134811679)
        <Info>You need appropriate permissions to add a bot to a Discord server.</Info>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Discord Self-Verification

Customers can verify directly on Discord using the `/verify <license>` command.

Running `/verify` links Discord account to your Lukittu customer and automatically assigns all roles you are entitled to through the product’s role mapping.

### Requirements

1. The command must be executed within a Discord server (guild).
2. Your team must have Discord integration **enabled and active**.
3. The product associated with the license must have at least one role mapping configured for the guild where the command is run.

## Using the Discord Bot

Once you've set up the integration, you can interact with the Lukittu bot on Discord:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
    <Card title="Bot Interaction Privacy" icon="shield-check">
        All messages exchanged with the Lukittu bot are ephemeral, meaning only
        you can see them. Other server members won't be able to view your
        license information or commands.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Access Options

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Server Installation">
        When you add the bot to your Discord server, it becomes available to all
        members (with the appropriate permissions) within that server.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="User Installation">
        If you choose the user installation option, you can use the bot's
        commands in any server or direct message, making it available for your
        personal use across Discord.
